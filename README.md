# 42-Libft
  Goal of creating Libft is to give us a chance to recoude our own standard C library which we are going to use in the future project following the strict
  rules of the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf) in the C language.

  Task Failed Successfully. Thanks to all peers and tester, all of my functions worked properly, except last one, which is ft_lstmap, that one was segfaulting and ft_strtrim. Even 
  if i was supposed to be graded down by Moulinette on this project I passed successfully as you can see.
